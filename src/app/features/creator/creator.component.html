    <p>
      IÂ´m the hands and mind of the game. I love escape rooms and I would like
      to create something portable to enjoy at home with your friends or family.
      I created the box with some recycled materials, cardboards, a little bit
      of wood, scissors and a cutter. I created the ideas for the puzzles and
      watched some videos and ideas on the internet to create a variation. I was
      trying to show to myself that I can make something good and be able to
      start a new "business". So I really hope you enjoy the game and of course
      I appreciate all the feedback =)
